        title: "8 Safe-Driving Tips for Teens with ADHD",
        description: `Teens with ADHD can learn to be safe drivers, but they often need extra structure, practice, and tailored strategies because driving heavily relies on executive function skills like attention, working memory, and judgment.
        
At a glance:

- **Build awareness of surroundings** → Practice "active scanning" by naming what's ahead, behind, and beside the car.
- **Slow down intersections** → Talk through right-of-way, yielding, and turning rules before reaching them.
- **Use visual reminders** → Stickers on the steering wheel can help with left/right and wheel position.
- **Start with familiar routes** → Reduce planning stress so teens can focus on driving skills.
- **Limit distractions** → Keep music low or off and restrict passengers longer than required.
- **Increase practice time** → More hours behind the wheel = stronger skill development.
- **Time medication appropriately** → Make sure ADHD meds are active during driving.
- **Choose informed instructors** → Look for teachers experienced with ADHD or driver rehabilitation specialists. `,

        title: "Traffic Signals (What to Know Fast)",
        description: `Traffic signals control who goes, who stops, and who yields at intersections. Knowing their meanings keeps traffic moving safely and predictably.

_**Big picture rules:**_

- Obey traffic signals at all times — unless a police officer directs you otherwise.
- If a signal is not working, treat the intersection like a four-way stop.
- Always watch for pedestrians and scan for cars that may run red lights. 

🚦 _**Steady Lights**_
- **Red** → Stop before the crosswalk/line.
    - Right turn on red is usually allowed unless posted.
    - Left turn on red only if both streets are one-way and allowed.
- **Yellow** → Prepare to stop. If you can't stop safely, proceed with caution.
- **Green** → Go when the intersection is clear; slow and look before entering.

➡️ _**Arrow Signals**_
- **Red Arrow** → Stop. No turn.
- **Yellow Arrow** → Turn is ending; prepare to stop.
- **Green Arrow** → Protected turn; you have the right-of-way.

⚠️ _**Flashing Signals**_
- **Flashing Red** → Stop completely (same as a stop sign).
- **Flashing Red Arrow** → Stop, then turn in arrow direction when safe.
- **Flashing Yellow** → Slow down and proceed with caution.
- **Flashing Yellow Arrow** → Left turn allowed only if no oncoming traffic.`,

        title: "Guide to Intersections",
        description: `Intersections can feel confusing at first, but knowing right-of-way rules and the type of intersection you’re in makes decisions much easier.

🚗 _**Right of Way (Basics)**_
Right of way determines who goes first and who must yield. Rules change depending on the intersection type.

🛑 _**Types of Intersections & Who Goes**_
- **4-Way Intersection** (two streets cross) → If two cars arrive at the same time, the car on the right goes first.
- **T-Intersection** (one road ends at another) → Cars on the through road have the right of way.
- **Y-Intersection** (minor road meets major road) → Cars on the major road usually have the right of way.
- **Traffic Circle / Roundabout** → Drivers entering must yield to cars already in the circle (from the left).
- **Uncontrolled Intersection** (no signs or lights) → Usually, the car that arrives first goes first.
- **Pedestrian Crosswalk** → Pedestrians always have the right of way in marked crosswalks.

⚠️ _**Smart Intersection Habits**_
- Pause briefly after a light turns green and look both ways.
- Don't assume others will follow rules.
- Avoid phone use while driving (hands-free only if necessary).
- After a crash, move to a safe spot, exchange info, and call police.`,

        display: "Following Distance",
        title: "Following Distance",
        description: `
**Definition & Risk**
- "Following too closely" means driving so near the vehicle ahead that even an attentive driver could not stop in time if the lead vehicle brakes suddenly.
- About 5 % of large truck crashes involve following too closely.

**Maintain Safe Distance**
- Larger trucks need more space to stop safely; rear-end crashes are common when following distance is too short.
- Recommended minimum following time: ~1 second per 10 ft of vehicle length at speeds below 40 mph, plus an additional second at higher speeds.

**Adjust for Conditions**
- In adverse weather or poor road conditions (rain, ice, snow, debris), drivers should double their following distance to allow more time for safe braking.
- Stopping distances increase significantly for loaded tractor-trailers versus passenger vehicles.

**Training & Awareness**
- The FMCSA includes video examples and training questions to help drivers recognize and correct unsafe following behavior`,

    parking: {
        display: "Parking",
        title: "Parallel Parking",
        description: `
Parallel parking is parking your vehicle parallel to the curb, typically between two cars.
- Allowed unless posted otherwise or curb markings prohibit it (e.g., yellow curb).

**Four Basic Steps**
- Signal and stop beside the front car, leaving about 2 feet of space.
- Turn wheels fully right and slowly reverse toward the curb.
- When aligned with the rear bumper of the front car, turn wheels fully left and continue backing up, staying about 6 inches from the curb.
- Straighten wheels and center vehicle in the space, ensuring wheels are within 12 inches of the curb.

**Key Safety Tips**
- Proper spacing and timing are critical to avoid hitting other vehicles or the curb.
- Always signal, check traffic, and move slowly and cautiously.
- Avoid parking more than 12 inches from the curb to prevent interfering with traffic.

**Practice & Learning**
- Parallel parking requires practice and patience.
- Video tutorials and defensive driving courses can help improve skill and confidence.`,
